## Linux

### Note:
Since every distribution has its own characteristics, a make install is not supported. The integration into the distribution must be carried out by each distribution itself. The same applies to metadata.


### Build requirements
* pkgconfig
* libqt5-devel
* libX11-devel

### Compile:  
  - get sources  
    - extract vokoscren-<version>.tar.gz  
     or  
    - clone git repository: "git clone https://github.com/vkohaupt/vokoscreenNG.git"  
  - change into the vokoscreenNG-<version> directory  
  - cd src  
  - qmake  
  - make
