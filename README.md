## Linux

### Note:
Since every distribution has its own characteristics, a make install is not supported. The integration into the distribution must be carried out by each distribution itself. The same applies to metadata.


### Build requirements
* pkgconfig
* libqt5-devel
* libX11-devel

### Compile:  
```
  - get sources  
    - extract vokoShowClick-<version>.tar.gz  
     or  
    - clone git repository: "git clone https://github.com/vkohaupt/vokoShowClick.git"  
  - change into the vokoShowClick-<version> directory  
  - cd src  
  - qmake  
  - make  
```
